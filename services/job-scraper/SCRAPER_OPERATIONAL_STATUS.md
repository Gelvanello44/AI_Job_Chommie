##  **NEW: September 2025 Automatic Quota System**

###  Intelligent Month Transition Management
**Automatic September 1, 2025 Activation**:
-  **Auto-detection**: System automatically detects September 1, 2025
-  **Quota reset**: Fresh 250 searches allocated
-  **Daily limit adjustment**: Automatically sets to 8 searches/day
-  **30-day distribution**: 250 searches ÷ 30 days = 8.33/day (enforced as 8/day)
-  **Safety buffer**: 10 searches emergency reserve maintained

###  September-Specific Features
- **Enforced minimum**: 8 searches/day regardless of remaining quota calculations
- **Dynamic adjustment**: Daily limits recalculated if quota usage changes
- **Background monitoring**: Hourly checks for month transitions
- **Special logging**: Critical alerts for September 2025 activation

###  Automated Tracking
- **Month boundary detection**: Automatic September 1 recognition
- **Settings persistence**: Month transition state saved
- **Quota scheduler**: Background service monitoring transitions
- **Real-time adjustment**: Daily limits updated automatically

##  Integration Points

### Data Flow
1. **Orchestrator** → Triggers SerpAPI scraper with quota check
2. **SerpAPI Scraper** → Executes quota-protected searches
3. **Company Scraper** → Enriches profiles with SerpAPI data
4. **Scrapy Spider** → Processes live data with real proxy middleware
5. **Results** → Stored with quota tracking sync

### Error Handling
-  Graceful quota exhaustion handling
-  Proxy failover mechanisms
-  API error recovery with reduced retries
-  Comprehensive logging for debugging

##  Next Steps & Monitoring

### Immediate Monitoring Requirements
1. **Daily Quota Usage**: Monitor against 78 search/day limit
2. **API Success Rates**: Track SerpAPI response quality
3. **Job Collection Volume**: Ensure targets met within quota
4. **Error Rates**: Monitor for proxy or API failures

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Query Efficiency**: Analyze which queries yield most relevant jobs
2. **Caching Strategy**: Implement intelligent caching to reduce API calls
3. **Batch Processing**: Group similar searches to maximize quota value
4. **Result Quality**: Monitor match scores and relevance metrics

##  Production Safeguards

### Quota Protection
- Multiple enforcement layers (monthly, daily, hourly)
- Pre-search quota validation  
- Post-search quota tracking
- Automatic session termination on quota exhaustion

### Failover Strategy
- SerpAPI quota exhausted → Fallback to direct scraping
- Proxy failures → Automatic rotation to backup proxies
- API errors → Graceful degradation with logging

##  Key Success Factors

1. **Quota Discipline**: Strict adherence to free tier limits
2. **High-Value Focus**: Only execute searches with expected job yield
3. **South African Focus**: Optimized queries for local job market
4. **Quality over Quantity**: Better job matching within quota constraints
5. **Monitoring Excellence**: Real-time tracking of all critical metrics

**Status**:  **PRODUCTION READY** with quota-protected live operation
**Last Verified**: December 2024
**Next Review**: Monitor quota usage patterns after 7 days of live operation
