# SerpAPI Quota Management Implementation Summary

##  Mission Accomplished: Critical Quota Management Added

### What Was Implemented

 **Strict Quota Enforcement**
- Monthly quota limit: 250 searches (free tier)
- Current usage: 16 used, 234 remaining
- Daily limit: 78 searches/day (conservative distribution)
- Hourly limit: 3 searches/hour
- Hard stops at all limit levels

 **Real-Time Quota Tracking**
- Live quota decrementation with every API call
- Automatic hourly/daily counter resets
- Critical logging for all quota changes
- Persistent quota sync to settings

 **Smart Query Optimization**
- High-value query detection algorithm
- Automatic low-value query skipping
- Limited query sets (3-5 per search session)
- 5-search safety buffer protection

 **South African Market Focus**
- Optimized queries for major SA job boards
- Entry-level and executive search specialization
- Fresh job content prioritization
- Major employer targeting

### Key Protection Features

 **Critical Safeguards**
-  Monthly quota exhaustion protection
-  Daily search limit enforcement (78/day)
-  Hourly search limit enforcement (3/hour)
-  Low quota warning alerts (≤10 searches)
-  Safety buffer reserve (5 searches minimum)

 **High-Value Query Algorithm**
Automatically detects valuable searches based on:
- Major job board sites (pnet.co.za, careers24.com, etc.)
- Fresh job indicators (posted today, yesterday)
- Executive/management roles
- Major SA employers (Shoprite, Pick n Pay, banks, etc.)
- High-demand professions (developer, engineer, nurse, etc.)

### Files Modified

1. **`serpapi_scraper.py`** - Complete quota management overhaul
2. **`settings.py`** - Quota configuration already present
3. **`SCRAPER_OPERATIONAL_STATUS.md`** - Operational documentation
4. **Test files** - Validation scripts created

### Quota Flow

```
Search Request → Quota Check → High-Value Filter → Execute → Track Usage → Sync Settings
```

**Enforcement Points:**
1. Pre-search: Check monthly/daily/hourly limits
2. Pre-execution: Validate query value in free tier mode  
3. Post-execution: Decrement counters and sync to settings
4. Session-end: Final quota sync and low-quota warnings

### Production Readiness

 **Ready for Live Operation**
- All quota limits properly configured
- Real-time enforcement active
- High-value query prioritization enabled
- Comprehensive SA job market coverage
- Graceful degradation on quota exhaustion

### Monitoring Dashboard

**Current Quota Status:**
-  Monthly: 234/250 searches remaining (93.6%)
-  Daily: 0/78 searches used today
- ⏰ Hourly: 0/3 searches used this hour
-  Mode: Free tier with high-value only
-  Protection: All safeguards active

### Next Actions

1. **Monitor Usage**: Track daily consumption patterns
2. **Optimize Queries**: Analyze which searches yield best results
3. **Adjust Limits**: Fine-tune daily/hourly limits based on usage
4. **Quality Assessment**: Monitor job match scores and relevance

### Emergency Procedures

**If Quota Exhausted:**
1.  Automatic fallback to direct scraping mode
2.  Alert notifications triggered
3.  Switch to cached data sources
4. ⏳ Wait for quota reset (monthly cycle)

**Quota Conservation Mode:**
1.  Activate emergency high-value-only mode
2.  Reduce query count per search session
3. ⏰ Increase time between search sessions
4.  Focus on highest-impact searches only
