### Issues Identified

1. **Missing Backend Dependencies**:
   - `logger.ts` utility was missing
   - `prisma.ts` utility was missing
   - Both files were created during testing

2. **Server Startup Issues**:
   - Backend server failed to start properly
   - Possible configuration or dependency issues

### Recommendations

1. **Fix Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd ai-job-chommie-backend
   npm install
   npm run prisma:generate
   npm run prisma:migrate
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Configuration**:
   - Ensure `.env` file has all required variables
   - Check database connection string
   - Verify Redis is running

3. **Run Tests Again**:
   ```bash
   # After server is running
   cd postman
   npx newman run AI-Job-Chommie-API.postman_collection.json \
     -e AI-Job-Chommie-Development.postman_environment.json
   ```

### Test Automation Setup

To run all tests automatically:

```bash
# Install Newman globally
npm install -g newman

# Run all collections
newman run AI-Job-Chommie-API.postman_collection.json -e AI-Job-Chommie-Development.postman_environment.json
newman run Auth.postman_collection.json -e ai-job-chommie.postman_environment.json
newman run Payment.postman_collection.json -e ai-job-chommie.postman_environment.json
```

### Next Steps

1. Debug and fix backend server startup issues
2. Ensure all required services (PostgreSQL, Redis) are running
3. Re-run the complete test suite
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
5. Create mock data for consistent testing
